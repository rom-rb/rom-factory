      [BREAKING] attributes are always passed as keywords (@alassek)
      This may affect your code in places where attributes are passed as hashes.
      Places like

      ```ruby
      user_attributes = { name: 'Jane' }
      Factory[:user, user_attributes]

      ```

      must be updated to

      ```ruby
      user_attributes = { name: 'Jane' }
      Factory[:user, **user_attributes]
      ```
